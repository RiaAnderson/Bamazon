## Description
The Bamazon app allows users to input orders and receive a response. Bamazon will display the total cost or tell the user the the quantity request is unavailable. After each order the stock quantity will be updated to reflect the amount of items ordered. The items for sale are stored in a mySQL database. Inquirer NPM must be installed to prompt the user to make their order selection.
